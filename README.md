# Task06vyankatesh

##  Objective
To implement and visualize the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using the Iris dataset.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

##  Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Iris dataset.
2. Used only the first two features to allow 2D visualization.
3. Normalized the data using `StandardScaler`.
4. Trained `KNeighborsClassifier` with various values of K.
5. Evaluated accuracy and plotted confusion matrices.
6. Visualized decision boundaries for K=5.

##  Key Concepts
- Instance-based learning
- Euclidean distance
- Importance of K value
- Decision boundary visualization

##  Sample Output
- Accuracy scores for different K values
- Confusion matrix plots
- 2D decision boundary

##  Dataset Used
[Iris Dataset from UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)
